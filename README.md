# dynamic-time-warping

This project uses the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to cluster stacks of voxels representing the subsurface of a region in the province of Flevoland, Drenthe. 
Two stacks are similar if they have similar order of lithologies (clay, sand, peat), though the thicknesses of these layers may vary between individual stacks.
